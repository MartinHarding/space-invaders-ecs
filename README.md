# Space Invaders (ECS)

An ECS implementation of Space Invaders using the Pyxel engine.

This project was created to help me try to understand how a game created with an entity component system methodology works. Besides reading much of the available material on Unity's ECS and hybrid ECS, I also reviewed GameDev.net's [Understanding Component-Entity-Systems](https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/understanding-component-entity-systems-r3013) article. [OOP is dead, Long Live OOP](https://www.gamedev.net/blogs/entry/2265481-oop-is-dead-long-live-oop/) is another interesting article on ECS vs OOP.
